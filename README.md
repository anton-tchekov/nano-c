# nano-c
Very small C compiler

Tested and works on an Arduino UNO (only 2048 bytes RAM).

## Features

* if-statement
* for-, while-, do-while- loops
* break and continue
* functions and recursion
* local and global variables
* configurable I/O functions
* int type (can be used as pointers to a global data area)
* generates bytecode that is then interpreted

## TODO

* switch-case
* structs
* arrays on the stack
* float, char type
* native code generator
* optimization
